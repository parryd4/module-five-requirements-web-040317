# Module 5

The goals of the final module are the following:

* Reinforce previous topics
* Prepare for the upcoming job search
* Prepare for the postwork period

The final module consists of two main components to accomplish this:

1. Final Project - weeks 1 & 2
2. Capstone Topic - week 3
3. CS Curriculum

### Final Project

You will focus on a final project that reinforces the material covered in the course.  You will be working on this project solo - this is a great chance for you to develop your learning. 

For this project, you should choose a realsitic "skateboard" version that you can complete. Try to get something working quickly that you can iterate on. Your project should have minimal dependencies on outside libraries and gems. There may be some libraries that are appropriate to use, but try to make sure that your project has some code that you wrote. 

#### Project requirements

In two weeks, you are tasked with building and Rails and React project that meets the following project requirements:

A. Back end requirements

* Build API using rails
* Two models minimum 
* Five non-controller ruby methods per group member
* Five related non-controller tests per group member
* Use of an external API with adapter pattern

B. Front End Requirements

* Implementation of React Components
* One CRUD resource built per group member
* Front end tests

### Capstone

After completing technical requirements, students move on to learn one of a defined list of capstone topics. Those topics are:

1. Design Patterns in Ruby
2. Performance
3. Redux

For each topic, we will provide some curriculum to work through and add into your project.
